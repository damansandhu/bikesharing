# Bikesharing
## Overview
This project uses Tableau to create a story visualization of Citi Bike user data. With this data, we analyze the user base to see if it would be profitable for Citi Bike to thrive in Des Moines.
## Results

* Most bikes are ridden for less than 20 minutes. The peak number of bikes are ridden between 0-10 minutes (about 145,000).

![TripdurationGenders](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damansandhu/bikesharing/main/images/NYC%20Citibike%20Analysis%20(1).png)
* When we breakdown the genders, men ride between 0-10 minutes as well as women. Although, there are almost 110k riders that are male, there is not difference in the ride duration between the genders.

* Bikes are rented mostly between the hours of 7am-9am and 4pm-8pm on weekdays (this could be when people are going to and from work/school).
* On weekends there is an even distribution of riders between 8am-8pm.

* Some bikes need constant repair while others do not.

## Summary
  From the gathered data and analysis we can conclude that it would be most profitable to focus Citi Bike rentals towards men. Women make about 25% of the total riders, and men use the bikes mostly during work/school hours to get to and from work/school. It is preferred to accumilate as many subsribers since they are much more likely to use the bikes. When it comes to repairs, some bikes are in constant need of repair while others rarely need any forms of repair. With the given dataset, if we could see which hours would work best to repair the bikes that are in need of repair to keep as many bikes on the streets at peak hours. Also, we could analyze the start and stop stations to provide most of the bikes at those locations for maximum rentals.
